# What's new for the DeXian Staking Earning (DSE) Babylon version?

* Full support for Radix Babylon
* Fully decentralized, open source implementation
* Support for two types of users:
    * Radix Liquid Stake users, who can securely, quickly, and easily receive 100% of the stake benefits through DSE.
    * Holders who need the flexibility to use XRD in a timely manner.
* Continued support for both normal and fast redemptions
* Providing XRD to the DSE liquidity pool earns interest, is completely under your control, and can be withdrawn at any time.


## So, how does DSE work?

There are three primary functions: 
1. Join,
2. Redeem, and 
3. Add or Remove Liquidity


The following are illustrative examples of each of these three primary functions and their respective processes.
