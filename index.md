## What is DeXian Stake Earning?

DeXian Staking Earning is a Radix-based liquid stacking protocol that allows users to participate in liquid staking quickly and earn stable benefits through the services provided by DeXian. The DeXian Staking Earning protocol will use algorithms to automatically balance the number of XRD stakes between different Radix validators, further increasing the decentralization of the Radix network and improving the stability and robustness of the network.

## Who created DeXian and what did DeXian do?

DeXian Stake Earning was developed by the technical team of KaiYuan Epoch Validator, which is currently a Radix Top 40 Validator worldwide.The DeXian team has been focusing on the Radix project since 2018 and we have not only participated in early Betanet network testing in 2021, operating Validators on Olympia and Alexandria, but also translated the Radix, DeFi and Radix Cerberus (A Parallelized BFT Consensus Protocol for Radix) white papers. In addition, We have participated in a series of Scrypto-Challenge developer competitions organized by Radix.

## What is the necessity of the Dexian Stake Earning protocol and what problem does it solve?

DeXian provides a one-stop solution to the problem of fast stake and stake, especially offering fast unstacke service. It allows users to eliminate waiting for the approximately 10 to 15 days unlocking period of Radix unstacke under regular cases, improving the liquidity of XRD, increasing capital utilization and providing convenience for users.


## How does DSE (DeXian Stake Earning) work before Babylon smart contracts go live?

The DSE currently operates in a centralized manner and it is an early verification product before the official decentralized service goes live (will be available when Babylon is launched).

The following are illustrative examples.

1. User JOIN 180 XRD,[https://stokenet-explorer.radixdlt.com/#/transactions/4731637ffb30819ae967e775283085a649861b7a42560af4381632e2605190ae](https://stokenet-explorer.radixdlt.com/#/transactions/4731637ffb30819ae967e775283085a649861b7a42560af4381632e2605190ae), The net value of DSE units at this point is: 1.09XRD/DSExrd(2023.2.20).

2. User will receive approximately 165 DSExrd equivalent to 180XRD,[https://stokenet-explorer.radixdlt.com/#/transactions/7b13576b36fd158882d95e68fdfed6ee351cf5b676c8d9d2d1572c5245bee6af](https://stokenet-explorer.radixdlt.com/#/transactions/7b13576b36fd158882d95e68fdfed6ee351cf5b676c8d9d2d1572c5245bee6af). **DSExrd will only mint when JOIN occurs.**

3. User wants to redeem 50 DSExrd after a certain period of time, at which point the net value is 1.02 (2023.1.12). [https://stokenet-explorer.radixdlt.com/#/transactions/2d047be598e63fa263fd14427a1efae568cd0d1c9ef8110c06c14b2f4aaa307e](https://stokenet-explorer.radixdlt.com/#/transactions/2d047be598e63fa263fd14427a1efae568cd0d1c9ef8110c06c14b2f4aaa307e)

4. User will receive approximately 51 XRD equivalent to 50 DSExrd, while the redeemed DSExrd will be destroyed and this is the record of the user's receipt:[https://stokenet-explorer.radixdlt.com/#/transactions/d0e1a77a52de21ce80a61d265f785315ad31c9f06f5ab532d5e3c6d9dc7aba6b](https://stokenet-explorer.radixdlt.com/#/transactions/d0e1a77a52de21ce80a61d265f785315ad31c9f06f5ab532d5e3c6d9dc7aba6b), (**Fast redemptions will incur a fee.**) The destroyed record can be found atï¼š

## How does the DSE generate earnings? What about the fees for fast redemptions?
The earnings backed by DeXian Stake Earning are supported through the earnings generated by Radix Staking. The earnings generated by Staking are all shared by the holders of DSExrd, which means that the net value of DSExrd will continue to increase steadily as the user holds DSExrd for a longer period of time, while the yield of DSExrd will also fluctuate in line with the Staking yield.

The fee for fast redemptions is currently basically equivalent to the earnings generated by 10 to 15 days of Staking.

## Is DSExrd available for trading?

DSExrd can be transferred and traded, users can use and trade with DSExrd on subsequent services launched by DeXian, or they can trade on DEX such as Ociswap by setting up a liquid pool.
